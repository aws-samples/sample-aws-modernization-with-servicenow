9. Populate the action as seen below, then click Done (we are populating with the Parent IDâ€™s we collected in Module 4.1): 
<ul>
  <li>Table: Knowledge Category [kb_category]</li>
  <li>Conditions: Parent ID is a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17 OR Parent ID is 9d4737cbff0221009b20ffffffffff33.</li>
</ul>

13. Click the plus icon, then set the flow variable to Compiled IT KB Categories. Click the script icon next to the text box that appears to make a script field appear. Copy and paste the below code into the area: 

var result = fd_data.flow_var.compiled_it_kb_categories  

+ fd_data._2__for_each.item.label 

+ "\n";  

return result;

14. Click Done. 

15. Next, add another Flow Logic item, and click Assign Subflow Outputs

16. Set the Subflow output variable to be Compiled IT KB Categories. Drag and drop the flow variable with the same name into the data field. Click Done.

18. Once test finished. Click on the link **Your test has finished running.View the subflow execution details.**

18. Click on the **Subflow Inputs & Outputs** and then **Subflow Output** to review the action that took place. Check the Runtime Value to see the list of IT Knowledge Base Categories that were returned.

19. Once you validate the categories returned by the Subflow test, return to your Subflow by clicking its name in the tabs at the top. Click Publish in the top right of the screen. If you get a message stating that this is associated to 0 flows, please ignore it and publish it anyway.

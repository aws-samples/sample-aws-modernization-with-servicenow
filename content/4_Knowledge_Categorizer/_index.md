# Use Case: Knowledge Article Categorization

## Using NOW Assist Skill kit (NASK) to Automatically Categorize KB Articles
 This use case covers automating the categorization of Knowledge Base articles at scale. Accurate categorization is crucial for effective self-service experiences, as it allows users to quickly find relevant information and reduces the load on support teams.

 The core use case involves using the Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic Claude LLM and NASK to process Knowledge articles data. The LLM can intelligently categorize articles by selecting from predefined taxonomy categories within the Knowledge Base. This automated approach streamlines the categorization process for massive article volumes, unlocking greater value from organizational knowledge assets.

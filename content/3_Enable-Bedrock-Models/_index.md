# Enable Amazon Bedrock Models in the AWS Console

Before we interact with Amazon Bedrock through the ServiceNow application, we need to enable access to the foundation models (FMs) you'd like to use.

> üìç **Prerequisite:** You should have already deployed the CloudFormation template and obtained your IAM credentials. If not, go back to the [Getting Started](/content/2_Getting-Started/) section.

## Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Console


2. Make sure you're in the **N. Virginia (us-east-1)** region ‚Äî this is where Amazon Bedrock is fully supported.

## Step 2: Open Amazon Bedrock

2. If prompted to enable the service, click **Enable access**.

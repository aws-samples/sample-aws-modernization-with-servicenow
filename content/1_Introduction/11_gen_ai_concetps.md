# ServiceNow GenAI Concepts with NOW Assist and LLM's <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING IF APPLICABLE -->
ServiceNow has made adopting GenAI easier by integrating its Now Assist GenAI experiences with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) fully managed service for building GenAI applications.

This collaboration enables enterprises to create custom AI skills tailored to their unique business requirements, unlocking new levels of productivity and innovation.


## Game-changing integration for GenAI
The Now Assist Skill Kit empowers developers to build, test, and deploy custom GenAI skills that integrate seamlessly with the ServiceNow platform using prebuilt templates and integration frameworks.

Amazon Bedrock simplifies the development of GenAI applications by providing access to foundational AI models from leading providers, such as Amazon NOVA, Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Mistral, and Stability AI.

With Amazon Bedrock, ServiceNow uses state-of-the-art models to power its custom skills, helping to ensure high-quality, contextually relevant outputs. Benefits include customization at scale, accelerated time to value, enhanced return on investment, and future-proof technology.

## How the integration works

Using the Now Assist Skill Kit, developers can easily integrate Amazon Bedrock’s large language models (LLMs) into their workflows. Developers define inputs, outputs, and parameters for their custom skills while the Now Assist Skill Kit handles model integration and workflow orchestration.

The integration enables seamless data exchange between ServiceNow and Amazon Bedrock. ServiceNow workflows pass contextual data to Bedrock LLMs, which generate outputs—such as summaries, insights, and recommended actions—that are directly actionable within the ServiceNow platform.

Using Amazon Bedrock’s real-time processing capabilities, ServiceNow workflows powered by custom skills can adapt dynamically to changing inputs, helping to ensure accurate and timely responses in fast-paced environments.

Custom AI skills built with the Now Assist Skill Kit integrate natively into ServiceNow applications, such as Virtual Agent, IT Service Management, and Customer Service Management, delivering a unified and intuitive user experience.

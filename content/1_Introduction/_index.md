# Overview
As the demand for AI-driven automation continues to grow, organizations are turning to generative AI (GenAI) to improve enterprise workflows, decision-making, and customer service.

## Generative AI at ServiceNow
The ServiceNow Platform and ecosystem is uniquely suited to generative AI. We have access to the hardware, the software, the data, and the people via our Element AI acquisition that is required to incorporate domain specific LLMs straight into the platform.

That means that we’ve abstracted the complexity of dealing with AI models and are able to deliver the latest technology in an easy to consume model, around the workflows you and your customers have already invested in to drive action across the enterprise. Because this is a single platform, all of our platform tools and workflows are going to be able to benefit from GenAI in various capacities.

Most of what you’ve probably seen relating to now assist covers our OOTB built use cases such as flow and code generation, incident summarization etc. But what if you want more? We are a platform after all, in everything we do, we simply servbe to inspire you to build and grow your own solutions on top of what we offer. Generative AI is no different.

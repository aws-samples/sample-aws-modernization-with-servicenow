## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information.

Further, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to:

- Test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness.
- Employ human oversight of output.
- Refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes.

This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure.

You agree to abide by ServiceNowâ€™s AI Acceptable Use Policy, which may be updated by ServiceNow.
